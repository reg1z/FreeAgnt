# AgentEnv

**(WIP)**

An Ansible playbook that gives you an isolated, pre-built, Debian development environment tailored for AI-integrated workflows.

### Goals
- Automate setup of an isolated Virtual Machine facilitating a secure development environment where AI agents can securely roam free.
- Initial support will be for QEMU running on Linux Hosts (Debian and Arch based).
- Include options for popular AI-integrated / agentic tools and workflows.
